                   I work with <a href="http://menzies.us">Dr Tim Menzies</a> on software engineering problems.
                   I work on estimating <a href="http://github.com/ai-se/george">software effort</a>, optimizing
                   <a href="http://github.com/ai-se/softgoals">requirements engineering</a> problems and
                   analyzing <a href="http://github.com/ai-se/citemap">trends</a> in software engineering publications.
                   <br/>
                   I am also the teaching assistant for <a href="http://github.com/txt/ase16">Model Based Automated Software Engineering</a> and I think
                   my students like me :P.

										Part of the <a href="http://ai4se.net" target="_blank">AI4SE</a> lab which works on applying
                    Artificial Intelligence techniques on Software Engineering. I am also an active part of the
                    <a href="http://bigstate.github.io" target="_blank">BIGState</a> club where we come up with Machine
                    Learning solutions to different real world problems. I had a summer internship at facebook in 2015. I was funded
                    by NASA for my masters for my work on estimating software effort for their space programs.
                    I graduated with a GPA of 4.0/4.0.

                  Graduated with a university silver medal. Topped my department with a GPA of 3.95/4. Apart from working on Electronics and Instrumentation, I also worked on projects in Image processing and Pattern Recognition using Machine Learning approaches. I also developed a 8086 microcontroller based basic home automation system in my junior year. Our senior year project of a digital sphygmomanometer was adjudged as one of the best for the academic year.
